# table

This is a simple table editor with arithmetic support. Enter the expression and press the key '=' to get the answer. Math object methods and actions with them are also supported.
For example, Math.sqrt(100) + 20, Math.PI * 2, and others.
By default, the table has a size of 4 columns and 4 rows (excluding headers). You can make the table more or less using the arrow keys or 
if this method does not work - using 'size x, y' command, where x is width, y is height. Type this command in the light green textarea field and press enter.
For example: size 4, 4 or size -4, -4. Negative numbers reduce the size of the table. 

Textarea field supports some commands to work with table. Press F1 to find out what is currently supported.
